# Touchdesigner project

In this project I aim to research the reactions of people on my toouchdesigner project. I created an api to send data to my database, which I created in MongoDb. In my api I created a GET- and a POST request, so you can get data from the database and post to it. It was a pleasure experimenting with Touchdesigner!
